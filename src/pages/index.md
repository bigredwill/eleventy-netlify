## More about me
I like building things that humans like to use. I believe intuition and accessibility are key for pleasing human-computer interactions.  

I am an adventurous and positive person who you'll probably get along with. Outside of technology I love: music and strange time signatures, falling asleep in fresh mountain air, riding skateboards, drinking coffee, making art, travel, and connecting with others, among other things.
