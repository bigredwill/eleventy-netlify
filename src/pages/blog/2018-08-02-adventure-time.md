This post marks the end of a year of stepping outside of my comfort zone. I travelled across the world to learn how others live and to use intuition to discover. One year ago today, I left an office in search of experiences outside of the digital realm.

## A Fresh Start

I spent four years at university studying Computer Science. After graduation, I stressed out about finding a job and starting my career. That said, I found a job quickly, one where I was learning, had great mentors, and was happy. I became a contributing member of the team quickly, and took on more responsibility with decision making and direction. I conducted interviews and presented to the whole company weekly. I felt confident in my coding abilities, and felt satisfied in the progress towards my professional goals.

But, something bothered me. I was ignoring my dream of travel. I craved an adventure.

So I made a plan to travel the world and purposefully left it open ended. I did some bookkeeping and decided I had enough for a year of budget travel. I gave notice, wrapped up my ongoing work, and bid goodbye to my coworkers.

## \#Vanlife

On the open road I learned to keep calm through multiple breakdowns. In a VW van I set out on and epic and slow road trip of the Pacific North West. I learned that smacking the fuel pump is an acceptable way of clearing any blockage. I became an amateur mechanic by necessity, but fell in love with getting greasy. Troubleshooting and fixing bugs in a car are so satisfying.

I [WWOOFed](http://wwoof.net/) in Oregon on my way south, where I learned to press cider and got dirty. I explored Oregon for a few weeks with a friend I made on the farm. We found hot springs, mountains, and more than a few skateparks.

## Trekking Middle Earth

Serendipity lead me to the Southern Island of New Zealand. I traveled with only a backpack on my back and a skateboard below my feet. I trekked beautiful mountains, ridges, and fjords.

I stayed in hostels, with WWOOF hosts, and camped beneath the stars.  I travelled alone and with others. Intuition was my guide.

Hitchhiking is a viable means of transportation on the South island. The tourists and people of New Zealand are a friendly bunch. I rode in a car with a family from Nebraska, a local adrenaline junky, and a guy from Oregon. Have thumb, will travel.

The bungy jump called, a New Zealand invention. I chose the Nevis bungy. At 134 meters, it is the tallest the country. I'd definitely do it again, and highly recommend it.

## Surfers' Paradise

Adventure called in Australia. I hopped the Tasman sea where I joined a friend and we surfed our way South from the Gold Coast to Melbourne. I learned to live like an ozzy, surfing and eating vegemite.

At a yoga retreat in the hills of New South Wales I deepened my practice of mindfulness and compassion. Through the teachers and community I learned to trust my intuition.

Intuition and cold weather told me the next stop was Bali, Indonesia.

## Eat, Love, Pray (Eat, Skate, Love)

After the initial culture shock, I fell in love with the island and it's people.
