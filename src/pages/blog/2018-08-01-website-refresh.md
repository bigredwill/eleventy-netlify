## A new website for new things and why I built a new site, again.

* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) static site generator.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) continuous integration and hosting.
* [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) as the CMS.
* [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) css toolkit. Atomic css ftw.

The code for this site lives at <https://github.com/bigredwill/wsimons.com>

I now consider myself a Software Engineer who specializes in the web. This direction in my career started from building and rebuilding a personal site, never satisfied with the editing workflow and process. It evolved into a deeper understanding of the web platform, and became domain knowledge that brings value to my work.

Rewind to my senior year of high school when I was learning to code. I had no idea **how** code could make a website appear in my browser. Thus I set out to learn and went down a long path to where I am today.

At first I built a few html pages with basic css by following a tutorial online. It was crude and pretty ugly. I uploaded the pages manually to shared-hosting server with ftp. It was tedious to do this, so I learned to automate the process with a bash script.  This manual process worked just fine, though mistakes were common and I was serving a lot of 404s. 

Then I discovered Github and Github Pages, and my workflow became more efficient.  I could make changes and  have them appear magically online! That feeling of magic fed the fire that lead me to pursue front-end engineering as a career.
